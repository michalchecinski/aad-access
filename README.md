This project shows how to setup Managed Identity and use it to create more secure apps in Azure. 

1. [Deployment script](https://github.com/michalchecinski/aad-access/blob/master/DeploymentScript.ps1) creates whole infrastructure on Azure.
2. Then you need to deploy apps (eg. from VS or VS code).
3. Go to just created webapp and see if it works.
